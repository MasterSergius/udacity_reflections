Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: I could see the changes I did, so bug is somewhere in that place.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: I could see who and what changes did.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A: Manual - do not clutter versions, auto - don't loose any part of work.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: Because sometimes it is very important to see diff between commits with multiple files.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A: git log shows history of commits with descriptions; git diff shows lines of code, which are different between two commits

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A: I can always go back easily to working version.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
