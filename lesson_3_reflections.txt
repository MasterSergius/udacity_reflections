Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I want to keep safe very important work. It will be safe, if my own computer broke down.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: It can spoil my work, if somebody added something to my remote repository.
